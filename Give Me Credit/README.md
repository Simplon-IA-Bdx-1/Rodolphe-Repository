# Project GIVE ME SOME CREDIT

First project with the school, we are trying to determine who in the dataset is more likely to have a default of paiement.

## To Start

### Requirement 

To use my app, you must have installed on your locale machine Spyder 3.3 (or greater) or Jupyter-Notebook (but I strongly recommand you using Spyder) in order to use the app.

### Installation and Execution

In order to use the application, you can simply download the .py in your local machine, and execute cell after cell (API is working under my account you should change it in order to have it for your account!)
