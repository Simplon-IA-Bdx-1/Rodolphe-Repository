# Project GIVE ME SOME CREDIT

First project with the school, we are trying to determine who in the dataset is more likely to have a default of paiement.

## To Start

### Requirement 

To use my app, you must have installed on your locale machine Spyder 3.3 (or greater) or Jupyter-Notebook (but I strongly recommand you using Spyder) in order to use the app.

### Installation and Execution

To use the app, you will need to follow two little steps : 
- Download the content of the repository into your local machine or virtual machine
- edit the file 'auth-public.env' and add your credential Kaggle and BigML
- Open app.py and run it ! (you may need to make some !pip install for the module who is not installed on your machine ;)

Enjoy!
